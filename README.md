# Temp-sensor-display
Example code for DHT22 temp/humidity sensor with 7x4 LED display output 
Board: QTPY SAMD21e18 
Written for/with Circuit Python 6.3 - library build from 8/22/21 

Notes:
This requires a Circuit Python version <7.x, as the pulseio has been deprecated/unsupported for small boards in version 7.x
This also uses a lot of the avilable memory, and will not run alongside repl/serial out.
